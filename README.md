## 👋 Hi, I'm Christian Göran

**Frontend Engineer focused on React, TypeScript and building complex, data-driven UIs.**

I work with modern tooling like **TanStack Query/Router, Zod, Radix UI, Zustand and Playwright**, mostly in cybersecurity and cloud-native environments.  
My strengths are predictable data flows, schema-driven forms, scalable component systems and clear communication with backend teams.

Before software engineering I worked in aviation — which shaped how I think:  
calm, structured, precise, and focused on building systems that don’t break.

## 📉 Note about this GitHub
Most of my recent work is in private repos (cybersecurity & enterprise projects).  
I’m gradually adding new public experiments, patterns and small tools when possible.
